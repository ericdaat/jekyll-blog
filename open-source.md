Here are some open source projects I am working on.

## [Sentiment Classifier API](https://github.com/ericdaat/sentiment-classifier)

The goal of this project is to create a sentiment classifier API that could use various models and datasets. It is written in Python and uses Flask for the API and tensorflow/keras for Machine Learning.

## [Notflix](https://github.com/ericdaat/notflix)

Notflix is an open source movie recommender system, inspired by a famous movie company. I am using the data from Movielens to build recommendation algorithms and expose them to users via a web application. It is a side project I started working on for fun and it is not yet fully completed. Feel free to ask for contribution on my Github.

## [Webradio to Spotify](https://github.com/ericdaat/webradio-to-spotify)

As a big fan of Classic Rock living in France, I am very frustrated by the lack of good classic rock radio we have. I spent four months in St Louis, MO, and I had the chance to listen to KSHE 95 every day, playing some of my favorite classic rock tunes. I decided to make myself an empty Spotify playlist, and automatically add in the KSHE tracks. I also wanted to be able to add songs from other similar Classic Rock radio. So I built a reusable architecture that enables to register different web scrapers to get the radio playing history and add that into my playlist.
