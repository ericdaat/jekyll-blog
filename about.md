Hi there! I am Eric, a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer from France.

My background is computer science. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in General
Engineering from ECAM Lyon, and an advanced master in Software Engineering
from Centrale Paris.
After graduating from Centrale, I went working for ManoMano, a french
e-commerce startup specialised in DIY and gardening. I spent 2.5 years there.
I pioneered product recommendations by building a recommender API from scratch,
that increased average basket by 15%. I was in charge of the whole project
and I learned a lot about Data Science, Data Engineering & Devops.
I also worked on product classification, and user tracking.

I eventually left ManoMano to join Doctrine, a french legal tech startup,
to work on Natural Language Processing. I worked on a Named Entity Recognition
algorithm used for anonymising legal decisions. I also helped cleaning
the code base and setting best development practices.

Besides work, I love music and especially guitar. I have been playing
for 14 years now, recording videos on YouTube. I also love photography
and I upload my pictures on 500px. Sportswise, I have been practicing
karate for 14 years, I am now black belt. I also like working on tech
projects, like a movie recommender system and writing tech articles
on my personal blog.
